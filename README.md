# Abstract-and-Sub-Classes
### This program used an Abstract Class and two Sub-Classes. It created two objects shape1 and shape2 using each subclass as the reference and class type.

#### Equality - whether the two objects are equal to each other
#### Class Information - from what class is the object 
#### Hash value - returns the hash value of the object
#### String value - returns the string value of the object
