# Abstract-and-Subclasses
## This program calculates the area of the shapes. It used an Abstract Class and two Sub-Classes. It created two objects shape1 and shape2 using each subclass as the reference and class type.
### The following Object class methods were used to check the Equality, Class Information, Hash value, and String value of the Shapes:
* equals() - whether the two objects are equal to each other
* getClass() - from what class is the object 
* hashCode() - returns the hash value of the object
* toString() - returns the string value of the object
